It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromString}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, and {@link valueOf}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\n */\nexport class DateTime {\n  /**\n   * @access private\n   */\n  constructor(config = {}) {\n    const zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone,\n      invalidReason = config.invalidReason || (zone.isValid ? null : UNSUPPORTED_ZONE);\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'ts', {\n      value: config.ts || Settings.now(),\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'zone', {\n      value: zone,\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'loc', {\n      value: config.loc || Locale.create(),\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'invalidReason', {\n      value: invalidReason,\n      enumerable: false\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'weekData', {\n      writable: true, // !!!\n      value: null,\n      enumerable: false\n    });\n\n    if (!invalidReason) {\n      const unchanged =\n          config.old && config.old.ts === this.ts && config.old.zone.equals(this.zone),\n        c = unchanged ? config.old.c : tsToObj(this.ts, this.zone.offset(this.ts)),\n        o = unchanged ? config.old.o : this.zone.offset(this.ts);\n\n      Object.defineProperty(this, 'c', { value: c });\n      Object.defineProperty(this, 'o', { value: o });\n    }\n  }\n\n  // CONSTRUCT\n\n  /**\n   * Create a local DateTime\n   * @param {number} year - The calendar year.
