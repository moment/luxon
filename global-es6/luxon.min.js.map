* A Duration object represents a period of time, like \"2 months\" or \"1 day, 1 hour\". Conceptually, it's just a map of units to their quantities, accompanied by some additional configuration and methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them. They can be used on their own or in conjunction with other Luxon types; for example, you can use {@link DateTime.plus} to add a Duration object to a DateTime, producing another DateTime.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of commonly used methods and getters in Duration:\n *\n * * **Creation** To create a Duration, use {@link fromMilliseconds}, {@link fromObject}, or {@link fromISO}.\n * * **Unit values** See the {@link years}, {@link months}, {@link weeks}, {@link days}, {@link hours}, {@link minutes}, {@link seconds}, {@link milliseconds} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See  {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation** To create new Durations out of old ones use {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link normalize}, {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link shiftTo}, and {@link negate}.\n * * **Output** To convert the Duration into other representations, see {@link as}, {@link toISO}, {@link toFormat}, and {@link toJSON}\n *\n * There's are more methods documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization and validity, see the external documentation.\n */\nexport class Duration {\n  /**\n   * @private\n   */\n  constructor(config) {\n    const accurate = config.conversionAccuracy === 'longterm' || false;\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'values', {\n      value: config.values,\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'loc', {\n      value: config.loc || Locale.create(),\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'conversionAccuracy', {\n      value: accurate ?

It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromString}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, and {@link valueOf}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\n */\nexport class DateTime {\n  /**\n   * @access private\n   */\n  constructor(config = {}) {\n    const zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone,\n      invalidReason = config.invalidReason ||\n        (zone.isValid ? null : UNSUPPORTED_ZONE);\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'ts', {\n      value: config.ts || Settings.now(),\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'zone', {\n      value: zone,\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'loc', {\n      value: config.loc || Locale.create(),\n      enumerable: true\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'invalidReason', {\n      value: invalidReason,\n      enumerable: false\n    });\n\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'weekData', {\n      writable: true, // !!!\n      value: null,\n      enumerable: false\n    });\n\n    if (!invalidReason) {\n      const unchanged = config.old &&\n        config.old.ts === this.ts &&\n        config.old.zone.equals(this.zone),\n        c = unchanged\n          ? config.old.c\n          : tsToObj(this.ts, this.zone.offset(this.ts)),\n        o = unchanged ? config.old.o : this.zone.offset(this.ts);\n\n      Object.defineProperty(this, 'c', { value: c });\n      Object.defineProperty(this, 'o', { value: o });\n    }\n  }\n\n  // CONSTRUCT\n\n  /**\n   * Create a local DateTime\n   * @param {number} year - The calendar year.
